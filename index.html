        Each tag that we make for our website NEEDS to go in the body of the document.

        Most, not all, elements, start with an opening and have an closing tag.
        In this example, <h1> is the opening tag and the closing tag is </h1>.
        Inside of the opening and closing tags are the content you want to show on your website.

        This is an example of a heading tag where it's the largest heading.

        This is a paragragh tag
    paragraphs are an exmple of block elemnets
    they take up the entire width of the webpage and they 
    add space above and bellow the elemts-->

    we showed the difference between block and inline elemnts using the developer tools,
    which we accessed using Ctrl+Shift+I. developer Tools
    is helpful to show you the
    exact code that is use that is used to display a elemt and can show you the width, 
    hight and spacing around the elemnet.

    links to the other pages created
        b is bold.
        s will cross out the text. 
        l is not an existing tag, it just displays your content.
        u is underlining.
        q is quotation marks.
